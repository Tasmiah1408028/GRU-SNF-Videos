There are two folders: GRU-SNF and GRU-NF. Each folder includes diverse sample videos generated using keypoint prediction with GRU-SNF and GRU-NF, where multiple predicted outputs correspond to a single ground truth video.

🔹 Video Format Description

Each video is divided into five segments:
1. Source video
2. Driving video
3. Intermediate content (not relevant to our current visualization)
4. Predicted video (generated using FOMM + keypoint prediction)
5. Additional content (included by default but not used in our analysis)
